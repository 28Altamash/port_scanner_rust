Network Vulnerability Assessment Report: SecureBank Inc.
Executive Summary

This report presents the findings from a recent network vulnerability assessment conducted for SecureBank Inc. using a custom-built port scanner. The assessment focused on identifying potential vulnerabilities in the bank's network infrastructure that could be exploited in cyber-attacks. Port scanning is a crucial element in this process, as it helps in detecting open ports and services that may be vulnerable to unauthorized access or exploitation.
Importance of Port Scanning

Port scanning is a critical cybersecurity practice used to identify open ports and associated services on a network. Open ports can act as gateways for attackers to access a network or its resources. Identifying these ports enables network administrators to understand potential vulnerabilities in their network and take appropriate measures to mitigate risks. Regular port scanning is essential for maintaining network security, especially for institutions like SecureBank Inc., where data security is paramount.
Port Scanner Overview

The custom-built port scanner developed for this assessment was implemented in Rust, leveraging asynchronous programming for efficiency. It scans a range of ports on the target IP address, specifically from port 1 to 1024, which includes most well-known service ports.
How the Port Scanner Works:

    Scanning Process: The scanner iteratively attempts to establish TCP connections to each port within the specified range.
    Open Port Identification: If a connection is successful, the port is flagged as open. This indicates that a service is running on that port and potentially accessible from the network.
    Service Identification: The current implementation of the scanner focuses on identifying open ports. While it does not explicitly identify services, the open ports suggest active services which can be further investigated.

Scan Results and Recommendations

The scan results indicated several open ports on SecureBank Inc.'s network. Based on these findings, the following recommendations are provided:

    Review Open Ports: SecureBank Inc. should review all open ports identified in the scan. Non-essential ports should be closed to reduce the attack surface.
    Service Audit: For ports that need to remain open, conduct a thorough audit of the services running on these ports. Ensure that only necessary services are active.
    Patch Management: Regularly update and patch services running on open ports to protect against known vulnerabilities.
    Firewall Configuration: Ensure that the firewall is configured to allow only necessary traffic. Implement strict firewall rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.
    Intrusion Detection Systems: Deploy intrusion detection systems (IDS) to monitor network traffic for suspicious activities.
    Regular Scanning: Conduct regular port scans to identify and address new vulnerabilities as part of an ongoing security strategy.

Conclusion

The port scanning exercise for SecureBank Inc. highlights the importance of regular network assessments in identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities. By proactively managing and monitoring network ports and services, SecureBank Inc. can significantly enhance its network security posture. Continued vigilance and adherence to cybersecurity best practices are crucial in safeguarding against evolving cyber threats. Regular network assessments should be an integral part of SecureBank Inc.'s security strategy to ensure the safety and integrity of its digital assets.
